-Type checker
-allocate constant arrays and strings on the heap and do all computations there
-builtin functions
-check that correct number of arguments are passed to function on application
-add support for preprocessor

loops
do while

order:
    1) main, print, integers
        example: function main(){print(5); print(8);}
