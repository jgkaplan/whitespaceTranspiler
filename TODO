-Type checker
-allocate constant arrays and strings on the heap and do all computations there
-builtin functions
-check that correct number of arguments are passed to function on application
-make all functions return things (add return as AST not as WhitespaceAst)
-add support for preprocessor

loops
do while

order:
    1) main, print, integers
        example: function main(){print(5); print(8);}

there might be some trouble with assigning in assignment expressions
for example,
x := (y := 2) + y
